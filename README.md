# Build a feature

The requirements are that the feature takes some user input and updates the DOM based on that input. In this case, user input refers to an event which can be listened for in the DOM.

# Description

This is a feature that takes a users input to create a linear gradient background.

User selects starting and ending color and once "Change color" buton is clicked, the function updates the DOM background with selected colors using the linear gradient.
